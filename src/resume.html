				<h1>About Me</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>Photoshop, Illustrator, and Coda are a few of the many tools that come easy to me.</p>

					<p>My attention to detail comes naturally; I love type, color matters a great deal, and have an unhealthy obsession with spacing.</p>

					<p>Compositions have to be balanced in one way or another. Designs must have integrity, whether it’s for print or digital.</p>

					<p>I have a great sense of humor.</p>

					<p>Usability, simplicity and consistency are always at the root of my designs. If it’s not simple to use, it’s not good design. Just being pretty doesn’t cut it for me.</p>

					<p>Won’t hesitate to share ideas about how to make a product better even if they fall outside of my expertise.</p>

					<p>Won’t pout if my ideas aren't chosen and realize that being part of the process is essential to a great outcome.</p>

					<p>Able to learn just about any technology, be it applications or web languages.</p>

					<p>I enjoy coding as much as design. It's all an art.</p>

					<p>I find satisfaction in passing on what I’ve learned by mentoring team members.</p>
