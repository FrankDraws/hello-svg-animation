            <p>While most of us focus on consuming information that we won’t care about next month, let alone next year,
                Buffett focused on knowledge and companies that change very, very slowly or not at all. And because the
                information he was learning changed slowly he could compound his knowledge over time. And as Schroeder
                notes, Buffett has been in business for a long time, giving him incredible opportunities to create a
                cumulative base of knowledge.</p>

            <p>Expiring information is great but it’s not knowledge. Here are a few telltale signs you’re dealing with
                expiring information. First, it’s marketed to you. Second, lacking details and nuance, it’s easily
                digestible. This is why it’s commonly telling you what happened, not why it happened or under what
                conditions it might happen again. Third, it won’t be relevant in a month or a year. Expiring information
                is one reason I stopped reading most news. It’s a false map.</p>

            <p>But there is another subtle difference to Buffett’s approach that often goes unnoticed and few people
                talk about.</p>
